# 🌍 Earthquake Analytics Dashboard

An interactive dashboard for analyzing **global earthquake data** across time, magnitude, depth, and geography.  
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis and visual insights** using historical earthquake records.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Earthquake Analytics Dashboard allows users to explore earthquake patterns from **1900 to 2014** using interactive filters and visualizations.

Users can:
- Filter earthquakes by **magnitude type**
- Analyze trends across **years and months**
- Explore **depth and magnitude relationships**
- Visualize **global earthquake distribution** on a map

This project is ideal for **data analytics portfolios, learning visualization, and research demonstrations**.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ Magnitude Type Selection (e.g., `mb`)
- ✅ Interactive Year Range Filter
- ✅ Total Earthquake Count Summary
- ✅ Multiple Statistical Visualizations
- ✅ Global Map with Earthquake Locations

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- **Total Earthquakes by Magnitude**
- **Total Earthquakes by Place (World Map)**
- **Depth vs Magnitude Scatter Plot**
- **Total Earthquakes by Month**
- **Depth Histogram**
- **Total Earthquakes by Year**

Each visualization updates dynamically based on selected filters.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Most earthquakes occur at **shallow depths (0–100 km)**
- Magnitudes are concentrated between **6 and 7**
- Earthquake activity fluctuates significantly over decades
- High activity regions align with known tectonic zones
- Depth and magnitude show **no strong linear correlation**
